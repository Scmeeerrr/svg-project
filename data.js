    "Started watching anime in the 5th grade, and I honestly can't seem to put it down after all these years. So many genres, characters, and philosophies just tie together neatly. My first anime was Attack on Titan (highly recommend by the way) and now I am taking on one of the biggest challenges; catching up with One Piece. At the moment, it is one of the longest running anime currently being shown, so trying to make it to recent episodes is a struggle. However, I am thoroughly enjoying how the story is going thus far.",
    "As I've gotten towards the end of highschool, figuring out what my major and future would be was still in the works. During highschool, I was enrolled in the Information Technology field, so I was planning on focusing on hardware repair and configurations until around 11th grade. Hardware was not getting boring, but learning software seemed much more important when leading technology into the future. That is why I settled on directing my studies towards Computer Science and Programming. Although it is a difficult course, I am more than prepared to tackle any obstacle the curriculum and industry has!",
    "When school returned to an in-person environment, I was extremely thankful for seeing my friends once again. However, something that randomly drove me forward was volleyball. In 10th grade, my tryouts were very unsuccessful but over the pandemic, I isolated myself and started gaining deeper knowledge on volleyball. The matches were highly intense and fast paced, but they always seemed wildly entertaining when everything flowed properly. Getting on the team was one of my greatest highschool achievements, even though the dream fell short after an unfortunate elbow fracture. It never ruined volleyball, but playing it turned into a hobby rather than a professional career.",
    "This might seem like an odd interest, but boxing always took me surprise. After watching a few matches with bigshots like Canelo, Mayweather, Haney, and much more, I saw how disciplined the sport was. No one held back and everyone was motivated to push their limits to the utmost potential. Entering the ring was basically like their job, but the dedication it takes to even get to that point inspires me greatly. Sooner or later, I plan on taking maybe a few boxing classes to harden and strength my mind while learning this form of self defense."
